The Project for the academic purposes o the we app for saving employees working hours (like SAP, but less advanced)

To properly launch the project You hav to:
1) Import database (mySQL) - I have been using the MySQL workbench 8.0 CE,
2) Open the project - I have been using  NetBeans IDE 8.0.2, that have a build in Glassfish server,
3) If the mySQL JDBC connector is not in the project, import it via Libraries-> add JAR
      (download mySQL JConnector driver from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ )
4)Launch the project
